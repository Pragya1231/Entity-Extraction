# Entity-Extraction
In this project we are doing web scarpping.
Firstly we are extracting data from any website and doing POS tagging, Lemmatization and Entity Extraction
The above all the names are part of preprocessing the data that is further used for doing feature extraction from the data.

Lemmatization : So Lemmetization is basically converting a word into its root word. Example - ate-> eat, eating-> eat.
POS taggiing :  POS tagging is assigning a Part of Speech tag to all the root words.
Entity Extraction :  Entity Extraction is assigning an entity or a domain to specific words. Domains are like person, Organization.
